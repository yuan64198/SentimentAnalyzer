What's New -- June, 2004

This dataset represents an enhancement of the review corpus v1.0
described in README v1.1: it contains more reviews, and labels were
created with an improved rating-extraction system.

Specifically:

  the names of the two
  subdirectories, "pos" and "neg", indicate the true
  classification (sentiment) of the component files.

  File names consist of a cross-validation tag plus the name of the
  original html file.  The ten folds used in the Pang/Lee ACL 2004 paper's
  experiments were:

     fold 1: files tagged cv000 through cv099, in numerical order
     fold 2: files tagged cv100 through cv199, in numerical order     
     ...
     fold 10: files tagged cv900 through cv999, in numerical order

  Hence, the file neg/cv114_19501.txt, for example, was labeled as
  negative, served as a member of fold 2, and was extracted from the
  file 19501.html in polarity_html.zip (see below).

  Each line in each text file corresponds to a single sentence, as
  determined by Adwait Ratnaparkhi's sentence boundary detector
  MXTERMINATOR.
